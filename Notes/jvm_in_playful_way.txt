Level 1: The Code Playground (Java Source Code)
In the beginning, you're in the Code Playground, where you write your Java code. Imagine you're drawing a toy
design on paper. This is your Java source code (like Toy.java). But this is just a blueprint, not a real toy
yet. We need to take it to the factory!

Goal: Write a design (Java code) and get it ready for the next step.

Level 2: The Bytecode Room (Java Compiler)
You bring your toy design to the Java Compiler, which is like a machine that reads your drawing and turns it 
into something called bytecode. Think of bytecode as a secret recipe or special instructions for building the 
toy, but it's not yet a fully working toy. It's like halfway there!

The blueprint (Toy.java) gets transformed into bytecode (Toy.class).

Goal: Get the toy‚Äôs recipe ready to send to the magic workers inside the factory!

Level 3: The Class Loader (The Gatekeeper)
Now, imagine you're at the gate of the Magic Toy Factory, but to get inside, you need permission from the 
Class Loader. It‚Äôs like the factory's bouncer. The Class Loader checks if the bytecode (the secret recipe)
can enter the factory.

There are three doors (kinds of class loaders):

Bootstrap Loader: This is the main gate. It loads important things that every toy needs, like the base
materials. Extension Loader: This door adds special parts if your toy needs extra features.
Application Loader: Finally, this door lets your toy‚Äôs own secret recipe (your class) in.
Goal: Get your recipe inside the factory by passing the Class Loader test!

Level 4: The Memory Room (JVM Memory Areas)
Once inside the factory, your bytecode is sent to the Memory Room, where all the parts of your toy are stored
 while it's being built. This room is split into sections, each with a special job:

Method Area üß† ‚Äì This is like a shelf where all the rules for building toys (your code's classes, methods, etc.) are stored.
Heap üì¶ ‚Äì This is the warehouse where all the big parts for your toy are kept, like objects. This is the heart of the factory where toys take shape.
Stack üß∞ ‚Äì These are the workbenches where the factory workers (threads) build your toys, one piece at a time.
Program Counter Register üìè ‚Äì Imagine this is a marker that shows the workers what step they're on while following the instructions.
Native Method Stack üõ†Ô∏è ‚Äì This is a special workbench for when your toy needs tools that aren‚Äôt made in the factory (like native methods).
Goal: Store all the toy parts and instructions in the right places.

Level 5: The Execution Engine (The Builders)
Now comes the most exciting part! The Execution Engine is like the group of toy builders who actually make
your toy. They take the parts (your bytecode) and follow the instructions step by step to put everything 
together.

Inside the Execution Engine:

Interpreter üõ†Ô∏è ‚Äì This builder reads each step of the recipe and builds the toy piece by piece.
JIT Compiler (Just-In-Time) üöÄ ‚Äì Sometimes, building toys one piece at a time is slow, so the JIT Compiler 
jumps in to make the process faster by taking shortcuts and reusing pieces.
Garbage Collector üßπ ‚Äì After building the toy, there are leftover scraps. The Garbage Collector‚Äôs job is to 
clean up those scraps (unused memory) so they don‚Äôt clutter the workspace.
Goal: Build the toy quickly and clean up the mess!

Level 6: The Native Interface (The Tool Shed)
Sometimes, the factory doesn‚Äôt have every tool it needs to finish a toy, so it has to borrow some from another place. This is where the Native Method Interface (JNI) comes in. It's like a secret door that lets the workers borrow special tools from outside the factory, like from C or C++ libraries.

Goal: Use special tools when needed to complete the toy!

Level 7: Garbage Collector‚Äôs Workshop
Remember that every time a toy is built, some parts get thrown away or aren't needed anymore. The Garbage Collector is a friendly janitor who walks around the factory, collecting all the junk and making sure the workspace stays neat and tidy. This way, your factory doesn't get clogged with useless parts!

Young Generation ‚Äì Where fresh, new toy parts (objects) are made. If a toy part isn't used, it gets cleaned up quickly.
Old Generation ‚Äì If a toy part is used for a long time, it moves here, and the janitor checks on it less often.
Permanent Generation (Metaspace) ‚Äì This is where the toy's designs and rules are stored forever.
Goal: Keep the factory clean and efficient!

Level 8: The Happy Ending
Now, your toy is fully built, and it's ready to be played with! The JVM factory has worked its magic, and your toy (Java program) runs smoothly. üéâ

Bonus Points: Boss Level
You can be the boss of the factory by adjusting how fast the toy workers build things, how much space you give them to store toy parts, or how often the janitor (Garbage Collector) comes around to clean. These are called JVM parameters, and they let you optimize the factory!

Example Boss Commands:

-Xms and -Xmx: Control how big the warehouse (Heap) is.
-XX:+UseG1GC: Choose which kind of janitor (Garbage Collector) to use.
