USING THREADS WHILE DOWNLOADING MULTIPLE FILES SIMULTANEOULSY

Lets learn how to use Thread to performs tasks concurrently such as downlaoding files. Each file 
download is handled by a seperate Thread, which runs independently from the others, simulating a download 
process using Thread.sleep() to represent time taken. 

Usage: Suitable for download multiple files and performing operations like I/O simultaneously.

Key Points:
=> Thread are created by extending Thread class.
=> Each Thread simulatees downloading a file and exectution concurrently.
=> start() begins the Thread exectution while sleep() simulates the delay.


PARALLEL ARRAY SUM USING THREADS 

Lets know how to use Thread for parallel computation. The task of summing an Array is split into two threads, 
each calculation the sum for half of an Array. After both Thread finish the results are combined. 

Key Points: 
=> It is used to divide large computation into smaller parts. 
=> join() is used to wait for the Thread to finish before combining the results. 
=> improves performance in tasks that can be parallelized. 

USAGE:
CPU intensive task can be broken into smaller independent sub task like handling large datasets or computation.
