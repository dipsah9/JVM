First lets get what a Thread is in a playful way. 

Suppose we own a restaurant(our computer) and there a head chef (our program). If head chef has to do everything 
on his own then it will take time and is not efficient. So we can hire some asssistant chef instead, who will help 
our head chef in assisting activities like chopping veggies, so at the same time our head can focus on other works
and provides quality and quickly serving to our customer. 

Same thread is like chef asssistant in the kitchen helping the Chef to run the system and all the activities 
simultaneously. 

There are two ways to create threads in java. 
    a)By extending thread Class
        => We can create a class exending Thread and override its run method which contains the code the Thread
            will execute.

    b)By implementing the Runnable Interface
        => It allows us to seperate the task from the thread exectution, giving more flexibility when working with
           thread pools and other concurrency frameworks.
