G1 Garbage Collector:
    It is designed for applications that requires prdictable pause times. 
    It divides the heap into multiple regions and performs garbage collection in a way that mimized pause times while maximizing throughput. 

    Key Characterstics: 
        - The heap is splitted into two region (both young and old generation).
        - It can mark live objects while the application is running. 
        - Moves lives object into new regions, allowing entire regions to be freeed. 

NOTE: To enable it, typically we donâ€™t need to set anything special, as it is default collector in java 0 and later.
        However we can customize it using JVM Flags.
