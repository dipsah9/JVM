Object Creation:
    The Balloon objects are created with automatic cleanup using the Cleaner class. 

Cleaner Class:
    The cleaner automatically cleans when the object becomes unreachable(eligible for Garbage collection).

Garbage Collection Suggestion: 
    We suggest Garbage colleciton with System.gc(), but Itâ€™s not guaranteed to run immediately.

Automatic Cleanup: 
    The Cleaner.register() method register a cleanup task (defined in the BalloonCleanup class), which will run 
    when the object in garbage collected. 


Summary: 

    Objects in Java are automatically removed from memory when they become unreachable.
The Garbage Collector (GC) silently manages memory by cleaning up these unused objects.
We now use Cleaner for safe and automatic resource cleanup:
Cleaner registers a cleanup task, which runs when an object is no longer referenced.
We can also implement AutoCloseable to trigger cleanup manually with the close() method.

This approach ensures efficient and safe memory and resource management, keeping your Java applications running smoothly.
